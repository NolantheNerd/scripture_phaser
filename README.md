## What's up with the Name?

Why is this tool called "scripture_phaser"? The name is actually a reference to a fictional weapon that appeared in an episode on of Focus on the Family's radio drama "Adventures in Odyssey" back in 1995 called "Hidden in My Heart".

In one particular segment of the show, the characters are parodying an away mission from the original "Star Trek" series with William Shatner. Sky Trip's own captain, played by William Shattered, along with his trusty sidekick Krok and one expendable crewman beam down to an alien world to rescue a damsel in distress. Among the other trinkets that they take with them are their scripture phasers. These devices thwart attempts to tempt the trio to sin by citing relevant pieces of scripture. The entire segment is very tongue-in-cheek, but absolutely entertaining.

The entire episode was released for free by Focus on the Family as a part of an episode of "The Official Adventures in Odyssey Podcast".
